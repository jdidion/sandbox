An interpreted language whose significant features are:
1. prototype-style OO - i.e. no distinction between objects and classes
2. build-in discovery, transparent cross-envrionment object access
3. methods as objects: all data, methods, etc are stored in "slots." any slot can be treated as data, or method regardless of it's "type"
4. parse tree grammar is xml-based. all tools (interpreter, etc) are written at the parse tree level.
